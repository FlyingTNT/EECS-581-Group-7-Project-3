# Smart Scheduler
A web app for KU students to select courses and visualize their weekly timetable to manage their semester schedule effectively

## Installation
To install the web server, download the [latest release](https://github.com/FlyingTNT/EECS-581-Group-7-Project-3/releases/latest) from this repository.

## Usage
This repository contains code for the web server for the Smart Scheduler web app. There is not currently a live website from which to use the app; you must run and connect to the server locally.

### Launching the Server
To launch the server, open a terminal in the `SmartScheduler` folder and run the command:
~~~
npm run dev
~~~

### Connecting to the Server
After launching the server, the terminal will display a local url to connect to such as http://localhost:5173/. You may use the web app by visiting that address in a web browser while the server is running.

### Requirements
The web server runs on Node.js, which can be downloaded from https://nodejs.org/en/download.
It also utilizes a number of Node.js libraries, which can be automatically downloaded after Node.js is installed by running the following command in the `SmartScheduler` directory:
~~~
npm install
~~~
